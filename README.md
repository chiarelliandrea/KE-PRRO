## [See a live version of the R notebook here!](https://chiarelliandrea.github.io/KE-PRRO/)

This deposit includes the text and data mining code used in the context of the [Knowledge Exchange activity on publishing reproducible research outputs (KE-PRRO)](https://knowledge-exchange.info/event/publishing-reproducible-research-output). It is also available via [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5512019) for citation and long term preservation. 

Three files are available: 
* the R Studio source code; 
* an html R notebook (see /docs folder); and 
* the dataset of tweet status IDs upon which the analysis is based.

The findings arising from the analysis included in this deposit are published in our final report, which is available in our [Zenodo project Community](https://zenodo.org/communities/ke-prro/?page=1&size=20).

This study has been funded by Knowledge Exchange (KE), a group of national organisations from six European countries supporting research infrastructure and services to enable the use of digital technologies to improve higher education and research: CSC in Finland, CNRS in France, DeiC in Denmark, DFG in Germany, Jisc in the UK and SURF in the Netherlands.
